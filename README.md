# - Computing AUC 
Completed by Agnes Folga. Program takes in 2 files, reads the probabilities of the positive class, sorts by ascending order, and correlates it with its positive, or negative classification. TPR and FPR are calculated, then the AUC is calculated by the change in x and y of the graph (not using traditional calculus as by guidelines). AUC value is printed to a txt file
#	- Input Format: (ID of test instance), (probability for positive class)
# - Implementing a Naive-Bayesian Classifier
#	- Including variable to switch smoothing on/off 
#	- Input: Any num of attr, where last attr = class attr
